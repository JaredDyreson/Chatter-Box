# Bauer Web Application

This is the skeleton code for the Flask web application we are going to develop.
Since most of the code here is already provided, I will try to not work on this much longer until we have a functioning front end.
I have included websites that do feature an RPN calculator so we have a template.
Please look into setting up virtual environments which helps speed up development (essentially containerization).
Also create the virtual environment directory name of `virtual_env` so it will be excluded from git commits.

```bash
# will spit out all of the python modules installed in the virtual environment.
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
